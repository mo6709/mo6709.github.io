Where to Start?
When you think about software you first think of fully functioning applications that will change everything but, where am I starting with all of these perfection and fully functioning application? You probably can find someone somewhere on the web that have accomplished that already, this where you begin to use your Google Search skill, your best friend (the smartypants friend) at this point just ask him he probably will has a premade template for something similar to what you are looking for. Following common pattern for what you are doing is a crucial thing since your code should be familiar to other developers you need to follow the right path, look for common pattern!


Your brain is one of the biggest wonder in this world why not using it? Although, it get distracted by not letting it work, please let your brain brainstorming don’t stop it, these brainstorming can be super helpful when you want to start somewhere, perhaps your brain have an idea so let it speak, all you need is let your brain flow even things that are not relevant shouldn’t be rejected write them down they particularly wouldn’t help but they will let your brain flow then, you can sieve out all the ideas and have a fantastic way to start.

Design it!

Software architecture is the most beautiful part of development, this is how pieces of logic collaborate with each other. There are two way to accomplish that one is by design a Functional Programing application second is Object Oriented (OO) application. Typically you will use OO for most of the time unless if you build a small application or develop at a very low level (C language). The biggest virtue of using OO is, you will need to design collaborating objects then, at run time they will be loaded to the memory which means the entire application(all the objects) have access to objects in the memory. However, Functional programming work differently, you will not design object collaboration, you will pass information as parameters and assign them to variable for later use. OO is all about who responsible for what? Each task should be assigned to the right object, do not forget to make sure that each method should have a single responsibility and clear description for the method name (programmers wouldn’t mind long name, they would mind non descriptive names), make sure to keep your code clear(good indentation), readable, and maintainable other colleagues would highly appreciate it. Practice DRY(Don’t Repeat Yourself) will make you a better programer which leads to abstraction which is a key in the design process.

Technics.
I know you are very smart. However, your cognitive thought process has limitations well, here is an amazing ancient method the White Board first, it can copy and past your thinking on the board which will free up your mind for the next step second, it’s visible than anything else because you draw it you engrave it in your brain third, it make the debugging process easier. Find common solutions (algorithm), if it works don’t invent the wheel. While you write your code you might change your mind somewhere down the line, you might want to integrate more features you don’t want your code to break you want to keep improve it, there is a perfect solution Git + Github they will let you backup your code then go back in time and get you program to a working state although, it mainly use for team collaboration, commit as much as possible you would appreciate it.

Outside Perspective.
When you write code you are very much convinced ‘this is the right implementation’, ‘it works why do I need a change ?’ so why other’s opinion important? Outside perspective can give you insight which you don’t have, they see what you can’t see, you know how things work you can circumvent it they can’t. Be able to take constructive criticism you will become better at what you do each time you learn from others, you will see huge improvement in terms of writing code once you take other people advices.


Solving Problems.
Let's start with identify the problems (knowing your problem is half of the cure), reade the errors they are very helpful in time of devastation, they ary the light at the end of the tunnel, in most scenarios they are clear and direct which can pinpoint what went wrong. Use the debugger, stop at the point where you stuck then, look at previews code and ask yourself why is this happening? What’s missing? Don’t freak out (what doesn’t kill you make you stronger), embrace the problems, code at its initial state is broken, every problem that you overcome make the improvement. Do not forget the enjoy it, this is your life.
