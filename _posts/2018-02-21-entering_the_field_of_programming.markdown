When the brain ckiet in to klif my actions where very thecniocals. the childhood was away to much fun I played almost with anything that was electrical. at coratin days i menaged to upset my parents to point whewr al the appliances at home were broken because of me. this is a the path that i paived back then. 
 
 Dueto ceriasety that i couldnot control anything new apliance that came home i had to brake it and put it back with maybe 10% of success. this is waht eludded me to think of how things works and cu=ous me to ask and attampts to understand all typs of machanisem with any pricetag. 
 
 The day of my first computer arraived and my curiasety ckicing in, i tested every litel file that was exsisted on the machain palyed with it deleted it and attempted to bring it back to life. All games were the most interesting parts that i giot to play with their directories where full of moving parts which i was tring to understand with no luck, but i keept playing with them they were away to abstracted and foghin for me. I loved the fact that i can make a surgey to my computer brain and if it did not work i copy paset the old barin and everything back to normal. it was a hug atvantage any other fisical machain that I was limited on how i can play with it and put it back to its initial state. 
 
 later on when the suticfaction of learning what is behind the since gow, and i chalenged myself by beign the guy how fixes any m types of achaiens for free this is where i got my first fear of not know what am i doing and which requierd me to read alot befor anything that i touch i dont want to bark someone else staff and not know how to put it back, it took alot to get use to the fact that i dont know anything there is an ochen of information out there to learn. I love that fact it is always make feel the you want more.
 
 At sortain point it seems that this is my dream any spare moment i was dealing with onothe problems that i ancontr in my way and solved it as i am thersty for more, this is wewr i decided that this is waht i want to do for leaving, i picked few books on networking and and gaind the knoledg that was requir to fix samll network bproblems, for ther the way to learn prograramming was ease to pick up and learn from milions of resources onlin. and the fun part is that i can test all my work bark it fix it with no fear. 
 about  a year ago 2016 i started to learn code on treeHouse and wanted to get more proficinal so i got enrold  the flatiron wonderfuln program to gain the requir knoleds that neede to develop web systems.
