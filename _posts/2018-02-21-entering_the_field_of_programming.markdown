This post discuss the process of getting into the Software Engineering feild.

I will describing my own path to it.
What your curiosity can do for you.
The required technical skills.
How to overcome challenges.
Decisions.
My Childhood
When the brain kicked in to life, it was so much fun. I played with almost anything that was technical, broke almost anything that I played with and somehow managed to put it back. Lucky, my parents were very patient, they understood that I want something and this is my way to get it. Those moments engraved in me, I was encouraged to do it, and more so they assisted me. It was pleaser that only kids can appreciate.

Curiosity
“Curiosity is a quality related to inquisitive thinking such as exploration, investigation, and learning, evident by observation in humans and other animals”. Wikipedia
Curious people always ask questions and search for answers in their minds. Their minds are always active. Since the mind is like a muscle which becomes stronger through continual exercise, the mental exercise caused by curiosity makes your mind stronger and stronger. Now that we know how good curiosity is how do we actually developing it, and make the best out of it? Here are some advices:

keep your mind an open mind. You should be able to learn new things forget them and relearn them if they are true or important.
DO NOT stop ask questions, so when, where, what, who, and why our best friends. Digging beneath the surface would teach you a lot.
DO NOT label thing as boring, whenever you label something as boring you just closed another door. Try to keep as much as possible open doors.
There is good feelings you get when your curiosity is satisfied, especially if it is a question that you found an answer, or spent a lot of time to study something and you get to the bottom of.

Technical skills
Technical skills can be hard to obtain, it is require a lot of learning. learn concepts to their core. You will need to become a student for life, there is always new skill that needs to be obtained in order to complete certain tasks. How to gain Technical Skills, first read a lot of books, it would improve your ability to learn new things. Go online there are great tutorials look for the one that your interested in. Hang around knowledgeable people, take class, and try to build your own software. The most important is to experiment as much as possible. By experimenting, you brain make the connections, it pick it up faster then just learn a skill in theory, once you get it working you have it! It might take forever to memorize new functionalities of new system, but with hands on experience it would take faster.

Overcome Challenges
Challenges are everywhere, especially when you enter to the Software Field it becomes a routine. It depends on how we take them. First differentiate between a challenge and obstacle. The main difference between abstecal and challenge is the intent, if the obstacle/challenge were deliberately placed in front of you. The intent of an obstacle is to block you. The intent of a challenge is to test you. Now you have to decide if you take the challenge, embrace it and prove to yourself that you can overcome it or otherwise. Challenges just make you stronger and pave the path to better way.

Ask for help it’s much easier to lift an heavy item with two people the just by yourself. People are happy to be part of success! Focus on the positive part as it is important to reach the main goal. Take your time, short breaks can be very helpful.

Decisions
Let’s break this section

Determination
Actions
Outcomes
To make a good decision. you will need to identify your goal. One of the most effective decision making strategies is to keep an eye on the goal. Gather information for weighing your options. Consider the consequences to their fullest extends.

Take an action it is waht make things moves dont get stacjknin one place, at this point you already somewhat identified what’s your best option, go ahead and do it.

Now is time to look back what are the outcomes, evaluate them, look into them in depth. It is also important to repeat this process as you go. Evaluating outcomes makes better decisions.
