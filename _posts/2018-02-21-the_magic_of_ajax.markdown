Time is money. The AJAX tool can be interpreted as a major improvement in the web history.

As of now we canâ€™t imagine ourself waiting for a response to come back from the server we almost instantly receiving responses on left and right. Thanks to the ajax tool that allow javascript to use asynchronous. The asynchronous free the thread from being busy and let other process on the thread being executed. With that in mind we can have better UX.

While developing with JavaScript we can take addvantage of using multithred system. The way Javascripts works is 'lets move on, dont ever stop'. with that in mind the once we right more complex forntend application we can let the user enjoy smooth transmitio. Javascriopt wil serve the user with somthing till the it will recive additinal data. This is wher AJAX comes in we send a network request which can take its time and all we do here is talling to our code pleas assign this taske to specific code once its done call this callback  again with the promise functionalty to assure we come back with some data somtime soon, menwhile to program move on the the next step.
